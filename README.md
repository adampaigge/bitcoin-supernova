Bitcoin Supernova 
===========

What is Bitcoin Supernova?
-------------------

[Bitcoin Supernova] is not the original Bitcoin.  It is based on the original Bitcoin 
protocol, will keep it stable, and allow it to massively scale.  Bitcoin Supernova will maintain the vision set out by Satoshi 
Nakamotoâ€™s white paper in 2008, but extensible for application to Superonva Labs.  This Github repository provides open-source software to enable use of Bitcoin Supernova.
